# GolfCourseCreator
Program to estimate supplies needed for a golf course. 

The utility of this program is to enter the length and width of the specific hole and the algorithms incorporated into the program will estimate how much sand is needed, how many bricks are needed, number of bushes needed, the amount of time spent mowing, amount of rough and smooth sod, and custom hole dimensions.
